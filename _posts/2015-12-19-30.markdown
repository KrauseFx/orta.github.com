So, let's just start with the highlight - *I got married* üíç.

Danger has been featured in thse posts since [On Being 26][26], 5 years ago, where [I created an iPad app][mixtapes] for her. She's gone from theatre-buddy to wife over the last 5 years, and it's been a really fun relationship.

Danger lives in the UK, so a lot of my conference travel has been motivated by our remote-ness. By travelling from NYC to the EU, I could spend some time with Danger back in England, or she could come along to where-ever. This made remote over the long run easier.

I spent a lot of time talking about how I should ask her to get married in the run up. She was coming over the NYC for 2 weeks, and I had the option to really do anything I wanted with that time. I settled on the simplest option - we went for a picnic in Central Park, and I asked her if she wanted to get married. We spent the next few hours looking for Pok√©mon in the Park and trying to plan the next few years of our lives together.

She's an awesome lady, and getting married hasn't really changed us as a couple. We can make more more dumb jokes now.

One of the inspirations for the change is that my VISA status has changed from H1B to O-1. The H1B meant Danger could come over to NYC with me, but would have forced her to either study or volunteer full time. The O-1 means that she could work in NYC, and that means independence.

I expect 2018 will be dominated by helping her move, and helping her get settled and finding her feet.

2016, what a year. The geo-political scene is slowly turning on it's head, it turns out thirty-year olds really do have different problems. As a British citizen, watching Brexit happen has been deeply troubling, and as an immigrant in America, I'll be living a country that elected a President like Trump.

I don't have much to add to that global conversation, but I can understand why so many people are so angry.

Due to this, a lot of my non-fiction reading has been around three main topics: Automation, Global Warming and Politics.

The highlights on each topic:

- Whole Earth Discipline
- Coming Apart - White America from 1960 - 2010
- Machines of Loving Grace

I am inspired by CDSSDC CSDC from Brett Victor to start looking at larger patterns. Which feels difficult when the problems seem to big and abstract.


{% include subheading.html title="iOS Community" %}

[On Being 29][29] opened with a long discussion on the Open Source iOS community and my feelings over the year. The fracture never healed for me, as not much has changed on that community front. Apple are still working on something which could hopefully replace CocoaPods as the core community build infrastructure, which is üëç.

For people who don't get the tech community, I donate the majority of my free time to building and maintaining infrastructure that makes it significantly easier to build iOS apps. I've done this for the last 4 years - it's a gratifying but tiring position, there's a handful of volunteers working on a project used by hundreds of thousands of people a month.

Personally I'll be glad to see Apple take over, CocoaPods is a huge community project and a lot of people rely on it. However, knowing that it's a project which will be replaced by an official version means that there's little motivation to improve. This is totally fine, but as it's a community project - **how does CocoaPods keeps the lights on?**

This is a predicament presented in [Roads and Bridges][roads-bridges], a paper on community infrastructure and dichotomy of so many relying on so few. There are a few answers to keep the lights on, but I don't have the energy or the will to start those ( as they are arguably more time consuming than keeping the lights on. )

The downside of knowing you'll be replaced is that people eventually stop contributing, which is normal, but new people don't necessarily take their place at the same rate. People will fix small annoyances, but it's harder for the project to keep up to date or do anything new.

{% include subheading.html title="JS Community" %}

This year I joined the JavaScript community. 

One of my favourite differences between the JavaScript community and the iOS community is the feeling of being able to build and fix your own problems. You can work on an entirely open stack, use open tools and can help out whereever you want..

JavaScript is basically the primordial soup of programming, which was fascinating to watch - and as a contributor this makes it easy to make a big impact. It feels like so many people are focusing on building the _next big thing_. This leaves a lot of gaps where you can put some time to bridging concepts and really making serious productivity improvements.

I'm now 5 years in to Artsy. When I joined we could fit on two tables, now we fit on 3 floors and 4 HQs. The company continues to grow, our scope continues to increase and the problems we face have changed. 

This was the year that we wrapped up Open Source by Default for Artsy, almost every project that _should_ be Open Source is now Open. It's awesome being able to always show your true work, and to be able to publicly show your struggles.

Artsy "the product" is maturing, a lot of the fundamental pieces required to pull off an idea like Artsy are set and work. This is awesome, because it gives us the chance to start thinking a bit further forwards than a quarter or two. I've mentioned over the years the new people I've helped hire for the mobile team, and last year we hired [Maxim] - she stands out as a solid engineer, a great speaker and a real product visionary.

I stopped being a manager this year, with that responsibility mostly falling to [Alloy]. He's always had more focus on what _needs_ to be built than I have. In leau of the managerial responsibilities, I've picked up a lot of janitorial tasks throughout Artsy - jumping between different projects depending on what seems to need engineering energy the most.
