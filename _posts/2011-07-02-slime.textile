h1. Slime

h4(code_heading). Terminal Command

{% highlight objc %}
  gem install slime
{% endhighlight %}

Slime is a (currently quite limited) gem for installing a command in terminal to open up Sublime Editor with files and folders from the Terminal. 

At some point  I'd like it to accept pipes and create files that don't exist yet, but TBH, this is good enough for the while.
