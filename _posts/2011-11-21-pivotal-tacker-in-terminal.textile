h1. Pivotal Tacker CLI

<div class="highlight" style="color:white;font-size: 0.8em;">
  <pre>
    gem install pt
  </pre>
</div>

Pivotal Tracker is alright, I still find it a bit cringey, one thing it definitely is though is information overload. So I took a look around and found an interesting pivotal tracker command line interface, and tweaked the hell out of it so that it works with arguments so you can fire and forget. The above script will grab my copy of it, make it into a gem file, install it, then delete the download. Simple.

Once you've got it install just type 

<div class="highlight" style="color:white;font-size: 0.8em;">pt help</div>

and rock on. Also, slightly crashy on ruby 1.8. Use 1.9 already.
