h1. 2.8 Hours Later

You’re in a city, a girl runs up to you _“Are you infected?!”_, _“No.”_ you reply. Turns out that was the right answer, though I think she’d have taken any answer that wasn’t *_“Garwrrrrrrr.”_*

2.8hours later is a zombie reality game taking place in your city overrun by, well, Zombies. It’s essentially orienteering, with lots of action, a story and some interesting characters along the way. You start off without a direction, only hearing word of a resistance to the Zombies somewhere. Perhaps the survivors are keeping together and you want to catch up with them, there are only a few survivors left.

The game takes place with small teams of 5-8, you’re given advice that the police are still the police, and even in this game hitting a bus will kill you. Teams are signed up and given an armband to indicate they’re players and are then sent off into the city every 2 minutes, giving you space to enjoy the narrative as a small group. 

The zombies aim is to tag you, they have UV pens that they will mark you with, letting the bio-hazard men know that you’re infected once you reach the resistance safehouse. You don’t have to worry about being tagged much, the game continues, and just like in real life, in your in-game death you distract a few zombies giving other players the chance to sly on by.

What follows is the experience Gem "‘Danger’":http://dangermcshane.me McShane and me had in 2.8hourslater Leeds, with our team of Lucy, Jay and Tom. if you’re going to go, consider this your only *spoiler warning*.

Ours started with a loft aim of finding the survivor safehouse, to do that we'd need to talk to another survivor, we were given his address. So we set off. Getting there really started to get our heartbeats racing, and the paranoia set in. We’d take corners on the outside, and walk through the center of the road at any opportunity.

The safehouse was a door, with a man driven insane by having to deal with locking his bitten granddaughter in a spare room. She stared out at us, vacant eyes, blood dripping down the window as she pressed against it clawing towards us. People nearby took video’s on their phones. We learnt that there really was a resistance, but to find out more we needed to find his abandoned car, where his radio was tuned to an emergency broadcast. He gave us a map location, and we set off.

It was on this route we started to see our first members of the living dead. She was laying down under a tree. The more daring members of our party decided to run past her, and as they had started, we must follow. What started out as a brisk jog quickly became a full blown sprint. And that was only one Zombie. 

Zombies.

We found the car pretty quickly, and though the directions were confusing, I’d lucked out and had awesome teammates who figured it out. We were going to a shopping center, in the heart of Leeds. That’s never going to be a safe place to hide. Turns out it wasn’t. There was only one way in and blocking that path  is another zombie. We hesitated, and other groups caught us up. This gave us an edge to run by, but in doing so split our small group of 5 into 3 separate groups. turns out she wasn’t alone. We were trapped with zombies in an empty mall, and the only entrance was once again blocked. Our options were press on, regroup and go up.

It’s hard to explain the chaos on the second floor as it all happened so fast, we’d left one member of our party on the bottom floor, but they were OK, the zombie was chasing us up the escalator.  Unfortunately, there were two more zombies, at the top running around the entire floor screaming. This genuinely terrified us, and shit hit the fan. One of the guys sprinted towards the mass of people at the top of the escalators splitting the group into two, and running full speed and stopping moments before sending a poor girl flying. She looked horrified. She got tagged out, giving us a chance to regroup, find the next escalator and to get further away from the living dead behind us.

As we’d ran through more and more corridors, suddenly a door opened behind us and a woman’s head popped through the crack, ”Have you brought the sweets?“ I hadn’t but it turns out some of our team had, and we were allowed into her room. She told us there was a butcher keeping track of the resistance down in the market, but that knowledge comes at a price. The price was boiled sweets, she had a very serious pile of those. We gladly paid and moved out through the fire exit.

!/assets/images/zombies/sweets.jpg!

The fire exit was busy. There were some tight staircases and zombies at the ends of them, there ended up being about twenty people being held up by one zombie. I think we coulda taken her, but that would’ve been rude, so she was baited in the direction of  one option and then people started to sneak around her back. Easy Peasy.

We had to find our way down to the old market. And by now we were getting pretty paranoid, so it was decided that the fastest route was probably not going to be the safest, we detoured through some small obscure alleyways and shopping arcades. The security guards giving us some very strange looks for our obvious paranoia on each corner.

Our walk finished up in a pitch black market, where fellow survivors jumped out at us and advised we get in as quickly as possible. We slowly stumbled around in the market till we spotted a man dressed like the  Texas Chainsaw Massacre killer waving garden shears towards us. Well, that’s not an invitation you want to turn down. So we caught up to him inside his shop.

!/assets/images/zombies/butcher.jpg!

Some people like to eat, yours truly especially. But this man, he loved eating, and he kept getting fresh meat arriving at his door. This man was pure video-game boss; tall, intimidating and great facial hair. He worried us enough that we would huddle in the door of his shop. The shop was covered in blood, and bits of meat draped all over the walls and floor. The butcher explained to us that there were people holed up in the church at the center of the city, and that people were going there to leave messages to each other, there will definitely be hints towards the resistance there. 

As we headed out another group came into the market, we started discussing the route we wanted to take to take that’d be the safest, so we started heading out back the way we came instead of the route directly infront of us. It was almost too late that we realized that the straggler behind the group we’d just walked past wasn’t part of their group. She picked up speed, and someone in our group shouted run back.  Gem and I were at the front of the group and we span on our heels, and sprinted through the market towards an exit. Our problem was simple though, she was gaining on us, and ended up only being a meter or two behind Gem before the zombie started to slow and face a group behind us. Panic averted, till it turned out that actually, she’d made us run into four zombies outside. 

We split, it wasn’t co-ordinated, and it was enough to get us all a bit of space to find a way towards some light. It didn’t work very well though, one of us tripped up and fell flat on her belly, Gem was chased off into the dark, and two managed to get to safety. I paused for breath and checked up on Lucy who had fallen over, she seemed ok, and suddenly Gem flew by me screaming *_‘ORTAAaaaaa’_* with a zombie-lady in tow. I caught pace with her and tried to drag the pursuer in a different direction. Which succeeded but it wasn’t enough, Gem ran directly into two zombies who promptly bagged and tagged her. One down. After that, the walk to the church was a breeze by walking down the largest roads, in those areas zombies are called road-kill.

The church was dark, I know I keep saying everything is dark, but it really was. The only lights were candles and some torches so you could read the giant messageboard. There as a priest chained up in the corner, he was trying to persuade another group to let him go, that he’d be really useful in getting past the groups of zombies because he thinks like them now. They weren’t convinced. Neither were we. He told us that he knew where the checkpoint for the resistance headquarters were, but no-one other than the gatekeeper knows where to find the actual building. He gave us a location, actually called the “ "Dark Arches":http://www.flickr.com/photos/26878207@N06/3006110890/ ”  an area under the main train track. The girls didn’t like that, it also was going to be a very dark place.

The route over was surprisingly uneventful, because Lucy knew all of Leeds like the back of her hand, we managed to avoid an attack or two by walking through some car parks. And come out towards the back of the Dark Arches. The road here had been barricaded my a survivor, the gatekeeper. He wasn’t a happy chap. Obviously science had got us into this mess, and he was damn well sure that it’ll do nothing to help the situation at this point.  But it was probably better that he got more people to the safety of the safehouse, and so he gave us directions towards where we needed to go, an "egyptian temple":http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/leeds/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8465000/8465935.stm in Leeds. He left us with a quick message

bq. 	Say hello to my friend- she was supposed to be getting married in the morning.

So we walked, in doing so we spotted a chokepoint, a bridge that could be the only way across towards the temple. A perfect place for a zombie ambush.  We split up, the fast runners ran ahead in that direction, whilst the ladies and I took the stealthy approach and crossed at a canal bridge a little bit further downstream. In doing so we missed a groups of zombie-women on a hen night, spitting at whoever would come near. Could you imagine a zombie running in stilettos? nightmare.

We regrouped on the other side of the bridge, and followed the general flow towards the temple. Lucy told us it was only about 5 minutes walk from here. So how would they finish the game? Well it turns out they do it by putting all the fastest zombies infront of you and forcing you into tight alleyways and then trying to pick you out one by one. As ever when overwhelmed, the group split. Gem and I took to the alleys, whilst everyone else  ran out towards the space of the car park. One of our group, Tom, had 3 zombies running full pelt after him at my last glance before ducking into the dark. 

Gem and I were in a square, with four exits, and one other person, he was walking pretty slowly towards us, and we weren’t sure which side of the apocalypse he stood on. So we backed off, so did he, I think he was thinking the same thing. Our hesitation had worked to our advantage, a large group had just caught up to us. And they were more all-in. They just ran out in the general direction of where we were heading and out of nowhere popped some zombies. Thanks guys! That could’ve been us. As some of that group were getting tagged, Gem and I sneaked past, and started to run towards a fence at the end of the carpark, directly infront of the temple. 

!/assets/images/zombies/biohazard.jpg!

We were barely fast enough, as we hit the fence there was a scream from directly behind us and a zombie ran directly to the fence which we’d very quickly left for dust leaving him groping air. 

We were here. But not all of us yet, we had seen Lucy and Jay, but Tom was still in the car park being chased by more zombies, and one of them grabbed him. Burn.

After getting tagged he came over to us and we got into the queue for disinfection, and biohazard testing. Those who were tagged were taken off into another room, the rest of us went into the basement for survivor evaluation, and resistance drinks. 10 minutes later we were reunited with our fallen comrades, who were now zombiefied. Awesome.

bq. 	Thank you for the scariest night of my life.

2.8hourslater was amazing, totally worth the money. Next time I want to play the first night, and then be zombies the next two. I’m still trying to persuade them to let me zombie the other nights now.
