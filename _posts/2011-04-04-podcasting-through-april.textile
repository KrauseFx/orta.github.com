h1. on making podcasts in April

I wanted to do something a little bit out of my comfort zone, so I figured I'd try a daily podcast for a month. Which turns out to be quite a ballache to get started. But I've got it up and running. 
This is "my setup":http://ortacast.heroku.com/ 

* Server
*# "Sinatra app":https://github.com/orta/ortacasts running on "Heroku":http://heroku.com
*# MP3s hosted on "Amazon S3":http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

* Clients
*# "Garageband":http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/
*# "Skype":/how-to-make-the-new-skype-not-suck/

* Distributors
*# "Feedburner":http://www.feedburner.com/
*# "Mailchimp":http://mailchimp.com/

The code, hosted "on Github":https://github.com/orta/ortacasts ( of course ) is a small webapp that contains a "few tests":https://github.com/orta/ortacasts/blob/master/tests.rb to ensure the data you put in to the server is valid before sending it off to heroku for hostage.

From there "Feedburner":http://feeds.feedburner.com/ortacasts eventually picks up on the changes and updates my RSS feeds, once that's updated Mailchimp picks up any changes every 8pm and sends out emails to people that prefer to get a mail update. Right now they're both about as popular as each other.

At some point later I'll talk about talking on podcasts.
