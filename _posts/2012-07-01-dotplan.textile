"Fabien Slangard":http://fabiensanglard.net/ is a guy who has been reviewing all the source code for the iD game engines, he's meticulously gone through all of the code to provide an even simpler level of abstraction. This makes understanding how the engines work at a level that even someone who's not that interested in a game engine could read and perhaps learn something about how you can write high performant applications.

What interested me was how Fabien was able to provide additional content for his documentation, like this

bq. Every single input (keyboard, win32 message, mouse, UDP socket) is converted into an event_t and placed in a centralized event queue (sysEvent_t eventQue[ 256 ] ). This allows among other things to record (journalize) each inputs in order to recreate bugs. This design decision was discussed at length in "John Carmack's .plan on Oct 14, 1998.":http://fd.fabiensanglard.net/doom3/pdfs/johnc-plan_1998.pdf

p(source). Fabien Stangard : "Quake 3 Architecture Review":http://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/

a .plan file? I clicked through to the link and was presented with all the design decisions and some of the minutea of keeping everything running. It felt a lot like a private blog. So I dug deeper, I love the way that he can talk about getting banned from playing blackjack at Vegas casinos and then on the same screen talk about texture memory on specific graphics cards, it's obvious that people used to follow and read along with these, as you can see him taking feedback and adding edits for people. There's an entire archive of "John Carmack's .plan":http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/carmack/plan.html files from 1996 - 2010. Reading a bunch had me thinking, so what is a plan file?


It turns of it's part of a program called finger, which is an app that essentially acts as a phone book for people on your computer network. Running it on a moden computer feels a little bit existential.

So .plan files are used as a network specific blog, you get the privacy to write about how much faster your Ferrari F50 is instead of your current F40 knowing that only people on your network will probably read it ( until someone archives them all online... ) and you get to do all the internal talk of what you're working on and why. I like this idea.

So I've decided that form now on, just as all projects I do use source control, they will all get a .plan file. I don't care that it implies that this is the "plan" I'll be treating it like a project specific blog that lets me know some of the issues that comes up and to provide a little bit more context to both myself, other developers and future software historians that may well be interested in why the web server I work with "broke my application another time":https://github.com/orta/Puttio/blob/c756674697019c95d2d4f688fe83943d31c7dca8/.plan.

If you work with me, expect to see these. If you don't, I'm probably going to hack up a project that looks through git commits and pulls all the .plan files together into a single-ish page app the next time I want to work with rails / node again.
